Hey I'm Michael, a software engineer and designer. I love building things that try to solve real problems and hack on things that don't. I've always got a bunch of projects going on. Reach out if you find something here you're interested in and want to know more or talk about over coffee â˜•.

You can run this site locally by running `yarn dev` and visiting `http://localhost:3000`. Check it out at [michaelschultz.com](https://michaelschultz.com).
