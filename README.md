# TODO

## general
- blurb about me (not sure I actually want this)
x change last line to be less self deprecating
- 'Design @ Sidwire' should maybe be longer or have more emphasis

## layout
x name at top of page
x tighten up the grids so they match up
x tone down music area (single row?)
x create portfolio section
x photo section
- podcast section (?)
x make top section only about work
x build out projects page
x build out individual project pages (sidewire, iodine, etc)
x swap 'now playing' and ways to get in touch section

## polish
x add background pattern and animate shapes
- animate background shapes
- change youtube links to use songlink.io
- clean up sections into components (header, footer, etc...)

## bugs
