                    I’ve been at Sidewire since November 2015 and have been the sole designer since June 2016. We’ve transformed our social platform into an awesome place for experts and readers alike. The best thing about Sidewire is that every expert is verified (no trolls!). We’ve had some incredible conversations that I don’t think could happen anywhere else.

                <h2 class="white pb4 lh-title">A spoonful of sugar...and whatnot</h2>
                <p class="white pb3 lh-copy">I was the first designer at Iodine. With a team of only a few, we built an incredibly honest drug information resource. Something that I'm glad exists today. During the first few weeks on the job, we partnered with the FDA to release and distribute a redesigned view of their resource of thousands of stuctured product labels or SPL's. This early product later turned into a feature of our main product <a class="white hover-purple"
                href="http://iodine.com"
                onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://iodine.com'); return false;">Iodine.com</a>. I left Iodine after 2 years and am thrilled with the work I was able to do while I was there.</p>
                <p class="white pb3 lh-copy">Another product I helped launch at Iodine was an app for helping you find out if your depression meds were working. We called it "Start" and you can find it in the <a class="white hover-purple"

                href="http://iodine.com/start"
                onclick="trackOutboundLink('http://iodine.com/start'); return false;">Start</a>" tracks your progress over time and then mirrors that progress back to you. Our goal was to help you make a decision after only 6 weeks. That's almost half the time it normally takes for a doctor to switch you to another drug if one isn't working.
                </p>
                <p class="white lh-copy">My biggest takeaway was that designing <i>and</i> building things is way more fun than just designing them and handing them off.</p>
